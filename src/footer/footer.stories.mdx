# Footer Component

Wrap the bottom of the page with important copywright/branding info, site-specific list of links, 
  and context-sensitive location, social media, and contact information (via `bulib-locoso`).

## Usages 

### Default (generic)

Without being given any information, the footer speaks generically about the BU Libraries
  and displays the sitemap for the `about` (wordpress) site.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="default">
    {html`<bulib-footer></bulib-footer>`}
  </Story>
</Preview>

### Known Library, Unknown Site

Here the library is specified to Pickering (`pel`) but we've not set any for this particular site, 
  so we can display hours and particular contact/location info, but still default to the sitemap 
  for the `about` section.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="known-library">
    {html`<bulib-footer curr_url="http://bu.libcal.com/booking/Pickering-quietstudy"></bulib-footer>`}
  </Story>
</Preview>

### Known Library, Known Site

At this url, we know both the `library` and the `main_site` (`help`), so we can display 
  library-specific information (`pardee`) as well as the sitemap for the askalibrarian site (`help`).

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="known-library-site">
    {html`<bulib-footer curr_url="https://askalibrarian.bu.edu/businessFAQs/"></bulib-footer>`}
  </Story>
</Preview>


### Known Site, Unknown Library

Here the `library` is unspecified (so we don't display any hours or particular info), but the
  `main_site` is known, so the sitemap is customized for askalibrarian (`help`).

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="known-site">
    {html`<bulib-footer curr_url="https://askalibrarian.com/"></bulib-footer>`}
  </Story>
</Preview>
