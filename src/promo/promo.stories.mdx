# Promo Component

Provide an advanced marketing-style box with a background image, 

## How it Works

Unlike many of our other elements that use _attributes_ to control the look of the behavior (like you would with `class`)...

```html
<bulib-component attribute_1="value1" attribute_2="value2"></bulib-component>
```

...this component looks for entire elements that have been plopped _inside_ of it with particular `slot` names:

```html
<bulib-promo>
  <h3 slot="heading">....</h3>
  <img src="...">
  <p slot="description">
  <a slot="call-to-action">...</a>
</bulib-promo>
```

This allows for greater customization and flexibility, while ensuring that a fallback exists, should the web component fail.

## Usages 

### Empty

This element is not meant to be used empty, but when it is (and the `debug` attribute is present), 
  it'll give you some information about what goes where.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="empty">
    {html`<bulib-promo debug></bulib-promo>`}
  </Story>
</Preview>


### Filled In

You can fill in particular parts of the display by specifying the following

- the `src` on any `<img>` dropped inside, will be used to set the `background-image` of the `.main` section
- an element with `slot="heading"` (preferrably `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, or `h4`) will go at the top 
- an element with `slot="description"` (preferrably a `p`) will go in the `.blurb` section at the bottom
- an element with `slot="call-to-action"` (preferrably a `button` or `a` with `.bulib-btn` added) will go below that


<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="example">
    {html`
      <bulib-promo>
        <h3 slot="heading" style="color: black !important;">this is a custom heading.</h3>
        <img alt="sample background image" src="https://www.bu.edu/library/wp-content/themes/bu-library/images/bg-body-noise.jpg">
        <p slot="description">this is a custom description that was added between the tags</p>
        <a slot="call-to-action" class="bulib-btn btn-light mhn">this is a custom call to action</a>
      </bulib-promo>
      <br> <br> <br>
    `}
  </Story>
</Preview>

### Optional Parts

If you don't have a call to action or heading (or whatever), you can leave them out and those parts will 
  be left blank.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="part-filled">
    {html`
      <bulib-promo>
        <p slot="description">this is a custom description that was added between the tags</p>
      </bulib-promo>
    `}
  </Story>
</Preview>

### Unconventional Customization

Technically, it's the `slot='section'` that actually powers it, so you can put arbitrary content in 
  the `description` if you'd like.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="unconventional">
    {html`
      <bulib-promo>
        <h2 slot="heading" style="color: black">Library Hours</h2>
        <div slot="description">
          <p>Different libraries are open at different times</p>
          <ul class="scroll" style="max-height: 60px;">
            <li><bulib-hours icon="local_library" library="mugar-memorial" link_class="white-link"></bulib-hours></li>
            <li><bulib-hours icon="business" library="pardee" link_class="white-link"></bulib-hours></li>
            <li><bulib-hours icon="school" library="pickering" link_class="white-link"></bulib-hours></li>
            <li><bulib-hours icon="science" library="sel" link_class="white-link"></bulib-hours></li>
            <li><bulib-hours icon="cloud_upload" library="astronomy" link_class="white-link"></bulib-hours></li>
          </li>
        </p>
      </bulib-promo>
    `}
  </Story>
