## About This Site (Storybook)

This site contains **living documentation** of the styles, elements, and helpers that we use 
  across our many websites.

  the repository, visit the [github wiki](https://github.com/bulib/bulib-wc/wiki).
- To view a component or style in isolation, select the **'Canvas' Tab**. Here, by pressing 'd', 
  you can pull up an additional panel with greater visibility into the individual component.
  - the **'Actions'** tab allows you to view the logs that are emitted when you interact with the component
  - the **'Knobs'** tab provides you the ability to manually alter various attributes of the component and see it change
  - the **'Accessibility'** tab shows various, automated checks that assess the degree to which 
- To gain an understanding of the purpose, context, and assorted usages of the component/entry, 
  read through the **'Docs' tab**.
