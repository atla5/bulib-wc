# Javascript Helpers

Having consistent utility methods for use within and beyond the repository 
  helps to standardize usage and simplify maintenance


## Importing the Helpers

Add the following `<script>` to the sitewide javascript to add them to the global scope 
  and enable their use throughout the site.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://unpkg.com/bulib-wc@0.1.50/dist/helpers.js" defer></script>
```
