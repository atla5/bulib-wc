# BU Libraries Announcement 

Used to show site-wide, time-sensitive, dismissable chunk of information with varying severity, a prominent message, 
  and a clear call to action.

## Usages 

### Default Component

by default, `bulib-announce` displays with a default message with an `info`-level severity and no call to action

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="default">
    {html`<bulib-announce debug></bulib-announce>`}
  </Story>
</Preview>

### Custom Message and Severity

Specifying a `severity` will alter its color and icon, and should be complimentary to the specified `message`.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="message-severity">
    {html`
      <bulib-announce debug severity="info" message="Situation-independent information"></bulib-announce>
      <hr />
      <bulib-announce debug severity="success" message="A user action has been completed or verified"></bulib-announce>
      <hr />
      <bulib-announce debug severity="warn" message="Something is wrong, but it's not an emergency"></bulib-announce>
      <hr />
      <bulib-announce debug severity="alert" message="Something is very wrong and needs immediate attention"></bulib-announce>
    `}
  </Story>
</Preview>

### Custom Calls-to-Actions

You can also specify a call-to-action text (`cta_url`) and url (`cta_url`). 

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="message-signin-cta">
    {html`
      <bulib-announce debug severity="info" message="Sign in to view 'My Favorites'" 
        cta_text="Sign In" cta_url="https://www.bu.edu/library/account/"></bulib-announce>
    `}
  </Story>
</Preview>


### Banner Dismissal

In order to not annoy the user (by presenting them with irrelevant or unwanted information), messages can be 
  dismissed (setting them to `disabled`).

#### Manual

This can be done manually - in which case it will always be hidden or `disabled` regardless of saved values.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="message-dismissed-manual">
    {html`
      <bulib-announce debug dismissed severity="info" message="Sign in to view 'My Favorites'" 
        cta_text="Sign In" cta_url="https://www.bu.edu/library/account/"></bulib-announce>
    `}
  </Story>
</Preview>
