# Announcement Banner Component

Used to show site-wide, time-sensitive, dismissable chunk of information with varying severity, a prominent message, 
  and a clear call to action.

## Usages 

### Default Component

by default, `bulib-announce` displays with a default message with an `info`-level severity and no call to action

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="basic">
    {html`<bulib-announce debug></bulib-announce>`}
  </Story>
</Preview>

### Custom Message and Severity

Specifying a `severity` will alter its color and icon, and should be complimentary to the specified `message`.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="custom-severity">
    {html`
      <bulib-announce debug code="severity-info" severity="info" message="Situation-independent information"></bulib-announce>
      <hr />
      <bulib-announce debug code="severity-success" severity="success" message="A user action has been completed or verified"></bulib-announce>
      <hr />
      <bulib-announce debug code="severity-warn" severity="warn" message="Something is wrong, but it's not an emergency"></bulib-announce>
      <hr />
      <bulib-announce debug code="severity-alert" severity="alert" message="Something is very wrong and needs immediate attention"></bulib-announce>
    `}
  </Story>
</Preview>

### Custom Calls-to-Actions

You can also specify a call-to-action text (`cta_text`) and url (`cta_url`). 

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="custom-signin-cta">
    {html`
      <bulib-announce debug code="signin-cta" severity="info" message="Sign in to view 'My Favorites'" 
        cta_text="Sign In" cta_url="https://www.bu.edu/library/account/"></bulib-announce>
    `}
  </Story>
</Preview>


### Banner Dismissal

In order to not annoy the user (by presenting them with irrelevant or unwanted information), banner 
  messages can be hidden by being dismissed (by setting them to `disabled`).


#### Session Memory (default)

By default, we try to remember which banners have and haven't been dismissed by using the `src/_helpers/storageUtility`,
  and look into the user's `localStorage` for the `announce-dismissal` for that specific `code`. 

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="dismissed-memory">
    {html`
      <bulib-announce debug severity="info" code="one" message="one"></bulib-announce> <hr />
      <bulib-announce debug severity="warn" code="two" message="two"></bulib-announce> <hr />
      <bulib-announce debug severity="alert" code="three" message="three"></bulib-announce> <hr />
      <bulib-announce debug severity="success" code="four" message="four"></bulib-announce>
    `}
  </Story>
</Preview>


#### Manual Override

For debugging purposes, this can be done manually - in which case it will _always_ be hidden (`dismissed="true"`, `dismissed`) 
  or _always_ shown (`dismissed="false"`) regardless of what's been saved in the local storage.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="dismissed-override">
    {html`
      <bulib-announce debug code="dismissed-present" dismissed message="'dismissed' is present, but unspecified"></bulib-announce> <hr />
      <bulib-announce debug code="dismissed-true" dismissed="true" message="'dismissed' is present and set to 'true'"></bulib-announce> <hr />
      <bulib-announce debug code="dismissed-false" dismissed="false" message="'dismissed' is present and set to 'false'"></bulib-announce>
    `}
  </Story>
</Preview>

_NOTE: clicking the DISMISS button will immediately toggle the `dismiss` value for the banner, save that value in local storage, and switch that banner's dismissal to manual mode until page is reloaded_
