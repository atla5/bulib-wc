# General Layout Information


## Deciding Between Flex and Grid

Here's a side-by-side comparison of flex and grid. Change the size of the page to 
  notice how the layouts differ in response to the screen width.

Particularly important is that `grid` does additional work to align items by column,
  whereas the items in `flex` are simply placed next to each other.

<Preview>
  <Story name="flex-vs-grid">
    {html`
      <h3><code>flex</code></h3>
      <div class="flexw bordered">
        <div class="demo">list item one</div>
        <div class="demo">list item two</div>
        <div class="demo">list item three is very long</div>
        <div class="demo">list item four</div>
        <div class="demo">list item five is even longer than item three</div>
      </div>
      <h3><code>grid</code></h3>
      <div class="grid-3 bordered">
        <div class="demo">list item one</div>
        <div class="demo">list item two</div>
        <div class="demo">list item three is very long</div>
        <div class="demo">list item four</div>
        <div class="demo">list item five is even longer than item three</div>
      </div>
    `}

### Min-Width Helpers

The `min-width` helpers resolve the percentage problem by specifying a minimum bound for 
  how wide the pixel width or responding to screen size. 
  They are very useful for quick-and-dirty responsive design:

_NOTE: use `.fill` to take up 100% of the available horizontal and vertical space of the parent_

<Preview>
  <Story name="min-width-helpers">
    {html`
      <div class="flexw flex-between demo">
        <div class="bordered half-width min-300"><code>.half-width.min-300</code>: expands to take up to 500px of screen width</div>
        <div class="bordered third-width min-200"><code>.third-width.min-200</code>: takes up 100% of the parent element</div>
      </div>
    `}
  </Story>
</Preview>

### Max-Width Helpers

The `max-width` helpers solve the "percentage problem" for large screens, by specifying a pixel width 
  or responding to screen size. They are very useful for quick-and-dirty responsive design.

Here, without specifying a percentage of the page, we're able to display these side by side until they collide.

_NOTE: use `.fill` to take up 100% of the available horizontal and vertical space of the parent_

<Preview>
  <Story name="max-width-helpers">
    {html`
      <div class="flexw flex-between demo">
        <div class="bordered fill max-500"><code>.max-500</code>: expands to take up to 500px of screen width</div>
        <div class="bordered fill max-300"><code>.max-300</code>: takes up to 300px of screen width</div>
      </div>
    `}
  </Story>
</Preview>
