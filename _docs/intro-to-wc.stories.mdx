# Web Components

Create and customize your own reusable html tags via (near) vanilla javascript!

## Description
- "Web Components" are essentially DIY widgets you can create once and reuse (almost) anywhere 
  as if they were regular html.  
- Their implementation is supported by a number of (recent and developing) web standards (Custom Elements, Shadow DOM, HTML Templates). 
- They are more portable/interoperable, more lightweight, and longer-lasting than traditional 
  framework-approaches. 

## Usage

### When to Use
- you desire the same UI element to work in multiple places/contexts (with some minor variation) [`<bulib-search>`]
- there's a piece of information/functionality you keep wanting to put in different places [`<bulib-hours>`]
- you want to consistently display a bunch of information contingent upon only one or two variables [`<bulib-locoso>`]
- you want to make a common element easier to use/read/remember in a libguide or something (e.g. simplify markup) [`<bulib-card>`]

### When _NOT_ to Use
- you could fulfill the need with less complexity for a single use-case quickly and reliably
- the thing you are implementing is only temporarily needed or will always be within a single technical environment (e.g. angular in primo)
- the functionality must always load immediately and be 100% reliable
- the functionality is central to the core operation of the site
- there exists an uncommon constraint on working on IE11 or without javascript enabled
