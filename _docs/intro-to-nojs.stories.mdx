# No Javascript

Not every interactable element/feature requires javascript!

## Description
- beyond being able to do things without frameworks and/or in vanilla.js, there's plenty you don't actually need javascript for
- avoiding javascript (and therefore any dependencies) ensures that it loads faster and can be used in all browsers/environments

### Background:
- [Principle of Least Power](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/leastPower.html): always use the tool with the least amount of dependencies 
- [Progressive Enhancement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-progressive-enhancement-and-why-it-matters-e80c7aaf834a/): the primacy of pure `html` is respected, the `css` just styles it, and the `js` could change it, but might not exist. the page is improved and enriched by the others, but the html _is_ the page  ["it goes from God to Jerry to You to the Cleaners" - Real Genius]
- Graceful Degradation: if anything breaks, make sure it breaks well - the page is still usable if something doesn't load or if js is turned off

## Usage

### When to Use
- you're working on a core aspect of navigation (`bulib-header`) that is "too big to fail" [banks in 2008]
- there's no main interactive or dynamic aspect to what you're trying to add. 
- the styling/layout of the elements on the page 

### When NOT to Use
- the desired functionality is not possible to create with just html+css
- the css and html are getting confusing, complicated, or just involved enough that you wouldn't want to recreate it or would have to copy/paste exactly
- you're interacting with javascript in a service or helper anyway
